# Project Rules

## Description
This is a portfolio website that serves as a creative canvas. The goal is to "vibecode" - meaning we prioritize aesthetics, creativity, and flow.

## Guidelines

1.  **Aesthetics First**: When making changes, always consider the visual impact. The site should look premium and polished.
2.  **Creative Freedom**: Feel free to suggest and implement cool animations, transitions, and layout ideas.
3.  **Modern Web**: Use modern HTML, CSS, and JS practices.
4.  **Assistance**: Be helpful and proactive. If you see something that could be cooler, suggest it!
